\arguments{
\item{a_g}{Shape parameter of the Gamma-distributed generation interval. Defaults to 5.}

\item{lambda_g}{Rate parameter of the Gamma-distributed generation interval. Defaults to 1.}

\item{a_s}{Shape parameter of the Gamma-distributed sojourn interval (time from inoculation to receiving a diagnostic test. Defaults to 5.}

\item{lambda_s}{Rate parameter of the Gamma-distributed sojourn interval. Defaults to 1.}

\item{R}{Basic reproductive number. Defaults to 1.5.}

\item{psi}{Second parameter of the Negative Binomial distribution.}

\item{mu}{Evolution rate, in substitutions per site per day. Defaults to 1e-6.}

\item{N_eff}{The within-host effective population size, expressed as the number of virions at time t ie exp(N_eff * t). Defaults to log(100).}

\item{init_genome}{The initial genome present in the seed of the epidemic. Defaults to a genome consisting of 1e4 random draws from A, C, G, T.}

\item{sample_dp}{A function with one argument, n, that randomly samples n read depths. Defaults to the function that always returns a constant depth of 10,000 reads.}

\item{sample_sb}{A function with one argument, n, that randomly samples n strand biases. Defaults to the function that always returns a constant strand bias of 0.}

\item{min_af}{Limit of detection for within-host variant frequencies.}

\item{N}{The size of the population. The population is assumed to be well-mixed, and to start with a single infectious individual. Defaults to 1e6.}

\item{p_samp}{The probability of being sampled. Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{n_obs}{The number of sampled cases to generate. Defaults to 100.}

\item{include_root}{Should the root (i.e. the first case to be seeded in the population) be included in the output FASTA and VCF files? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{start_date}{Date on which the first case is inoculated. Defaults to January 1st, 2000.}

\item{outdir}{Name of the output directory. Defaults to "my_epidemic."}

\item{seed}{If integer, the seed is set to that integer. If NA, no seed is set. Defaults to NA.}
}
\value{
A directory containing a single FASTA for all simulated cases, a FASTA consisting of the reference genome, VCF files for each simulated case, and the times of sample collection relative to the inoculation time of the first case (in days).
}
\description{
This function simulates pathogen spread through a population, given user-specified parameters. It outputs genomic and epidemiological data for each case, including read-level sequencing data.
